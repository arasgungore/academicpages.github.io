The aim of teaching is to prepare future architects and civil engineers for the challenges of digitization and sustainability. The basis of teaching in the department is the teaching of digital methods in construction with all technical and disciplinary aspects. Integrated into digital models, engineering calculations and simulations of key performance aspects such as energy efficiency and life cycle analysis for sustainability are taught. This includes methodological knowledge and application competence in the following fields:

- Digital modeling, parametric and semantic models, BIM
- Engineering analysis and simulation
- Systems engineering and optimization
- Methods of AI, ML and other data analysis methods
- Knowledge of appropriate software tools

This knowledge and skills are deepened as a support in building design through project-based applications. Graduates should be able to work with digital data, models, methods and tools in design and planning and, on this basis, to develop model-based sustainable solutions for the built environment across disciplines.
