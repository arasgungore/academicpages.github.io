excerpt: '
Our manuscript delves deep into the pivotal role of causal inference in building engineering. It brings to light the potential pitfalls of solely relying on data-driven models, devoid of robust causal analysis. Through a meticulously crafted flow chart, we lay out the intricate information flow between first-principles models, machine learning methods, and the end-user. This visual representation further reinforces our argument, demonstrating the significance of interlinking causal analysis for informed decision-making and highlighting its preventive role against drawing misleading conclusions in our industry.

**Abstract**: <br>
The decision-making process in real-world implementations has been affected by a growing reliance on data-driven models. We investigated the synergetic pattern between the data-driven methods, empirical domain knowledge, and first-principles simulations. We showed the potential risk of biased results when using data-driven models without causal analysis. Using a case study assessing the implication of several design solutions on the energy consumption of a building, we proved the necessity of causal analysis during the data-driven modeling process. We concluded that: (a) Data-driven models' accuracy assessment or domain knowledge screening may not rule out biased and spurious results; (b) Data-driven models' feature selection should involve careful consideration of causal relationships, especially colliders; (c) Causal analysis results can be used as an aid to first-principles simulation design and parameter checking to avoid cognitive biases. We proved the benefits of causal analysis when applied to data-driven models in building engineering.
