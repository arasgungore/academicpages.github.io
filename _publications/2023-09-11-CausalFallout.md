**Abstract**: <br>
The decision-making process in real-world implementations has been affected by a growing reliance on data-driven models. Recognizing the limitations of isolated methodologies - namely, the lack of domain understanding in data-driven models, the subjective nature of empirical knowledge, and the idealized assumptions in first-principles simulations, we explore their synergetic integration. We showed the potential risk of biased results when using data-driven models without causal analysis. Through a case study on energy consumption in building design, we demonstrate how causal analysis significantly enhances the modeling process, mitigating biases and spurious correlations. We concluded that: (a) Sole data-driven models' accuracy assessment or domain knowledge screening may not rule out biased and spurious results; (b) Data-driven models' feature selection should involve careful consideration of causal relationships, especially colliders; (c) Integrating causal analysis results aid to first-principles simulation design and parameter checking to avoid cognitive biases. We advocate for the routine integration of causal inference within data-driven models in engineering practices, emphasizing its critical role in ensuring the models' reliability and real-world applicability.
