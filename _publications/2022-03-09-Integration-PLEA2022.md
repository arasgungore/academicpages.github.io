**Abstract**: The level of intelligence in current building facilities has benefited from two subsequent aspects: 1. Optimal design of energy systems through simulation software and first-principles models; 2. System load and energy usage behaviour prediction through machine learning (ML). Through the literature review, we find a limitation between the current optimization algorithms and the controlling strategy in development: The current control strategies rely merely on receiving real-time feedback or using predictive leading signals with less consideration of taking also historical behaviour information for optimization. Inspired by the gradient boosting technique, we proposed an engineer-friendly framework by comprehending dynamic time-domain relationships among features with a loop integrated by ML forecasting algorithm and physics-based simulation. The feedforward behaviour proceeds via the forecasting algorithm with leading and lagging signals involved. The combined information is imported into simulation; Then, the new results feedback to minimize the errors of its forecasting predecessor as a loop to achieve an overall optimization eventually. We tested our framework in a case for heating system control with serval benchmarks. The results show the superiority of our framework on energy-saving performance.
