**Abstract**: 

**Aim and approach:**
The rising consideration of the environmental impact in energy systems draws higher standards for physical simulations in dimensioning different complex district heating network scenarios, including accuracy and efficiency in real-time scope. This study aims to explore the possibility of replacing physical models of thermal networks with advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms for different topologies and investigates the influence of critical parameters of the network system on the accuracy of the results during the design phase. This paper presents a component-based machine learning (CBML) approach to reducing the complexity of individual components of district heating networks. CBML approach embedded the topology information into component model organizations to produce comprehensive, accurate, and flexible results. More specifically, we use physical parameters to describe and construct the thermal networks first-principles models in various topologies. Second, based on component-level to build and train CBML models embedded in different topology organizations to adapt to corresponding scenarios. Third, predicting critical network output parameters (i.e. heat loss, cost, and pipeline hydraulic losses). Finally, an investigation between prediction accuracy bounds for CBML models and physical models regards to topology complexity is conducted and discussed in this study.

**Scientific innovation and relevance:**
Nowadays, district heating networks have gained attention for planners, policymakers, and other stakeholders to reach climate targets. The modeling of heating networks relies mainly on physical, first-principles models such as Modelica and Trnsys. However, physical models normally require considerable computational resources and efforts in input describing data precisely. As a computationally-intensive approach, this drawback became major obstacle as the thermal network expanded in scale with more parameters. Therefore, the necessity of improving efficiency by combining traditional physical models with ML  approaches as a plausible approach becomes significant. 
In the application of ML to heating networks is mainly focused on load forecasting and network leak detection in the operational phase. To our best knowledge, there are only a few studies that emphasize modeling thermal networks regards to topologies using ML algorithms. Thus, the novelty of this research lies in the following three-fold: 1) a data-driven approach to adapt general thermal network simulation is developed; 2) Based on the proposed approach, a comprehensive accuracy comparison of algorithm performance on different modeling pipelines; 3) The impact investigation between the complexity of topology organization and the accuracy on CBML approach is explored.

**Preliminary results and conclusion:**
In the first stage, we conduct a feasibility investigation of ML approaches in the district heating network simulation by adapting three common approaches, artificial neural network (ANNs), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) with the data of first principles models. The prediction accuracy of different key parameters is improved by structure information embedded in CBML approach. The result shows the impact of different CBML models on the results' accuracy and convergence speed. Furthermore, the suggested CBML model reaches novel results with significantly less computational time while maintaining comparable accuracies compared to corresponding physical models. This approach owns great potential to adapt in different organizations as one of the surrogate modeling that enhance the development of thermal networks dimensioning and optimization in a faster and more flexible behavior.
