excerpt: '
In the evolving landscape of machine learning in engineering, the discourse often veers toward the contrast between first-principles models and data-driven approaches. However, bridging these approaches has remained an under-explored territory. This manuscript delves into this intersection, offering a foundational framework to seamlessly incorporate domain knowledge into the data-driven methodology. Serving as a pivotal reference, the paper proposed a comprehensive picture of the ladder of knowledge-integrated machine learning. By setting the context in the building engineering domain as a demonstration, we explore the instrumental in shaping our understanding of knowledge integration in the modern engineering realm, clarifying the synergistic knowledge integration across different stages of the data-driven process.

**Abstract**: <br>
Despite the digitalization trend and data volume surge, first-principles models (also known as logic-driven, physics-based, rule-based, or knowledge-based models) and data-driven approaches have existed in parallel, mirroring the ongoing AI debate on symbolism versus connectionism. Research for process development to integrate both sides to transfer and utilize domain knowledge in the data-driven process is rare. This study emphasizes efforts and prevailing trends to integrate multidisciplinary domain professions into machine-acknowledgeable, data-driven processes in a two-fold organization: examining information uncertainty sources in knowledge representation and exploring knowledge decomposition with a three-tier knowledge-integrated machine learning paradigm. This approach balances holist and reductionist perspectives in the engineering domain.<Br>
