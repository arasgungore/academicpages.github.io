excerpt: '
Proposing a paradigm to systematically embed prior knowledge and domain insights into data-driven models, addressing domain-specific challenges through three levels of knowledge integration: modeling knowledge for system description, inductive logic and disentanglement for extrapolation, and abstract reasoning and deductive logic for representation. We demonstrated this paradigm in the context of building engineering.

**Abstract**: <br>
Despite the digitalization trend and data volume surge, first-principles models (also known as logic-driven, physics-based, rule-based, or knowledge-based models) and data-driven approaches have existed in parallel, mirroring the ongoing AI debate on symbolism versus connectionism. Research for process development to integrate both sides to transfer and utilize domain knowledge in the data-driven process is rare. This study emphasizes efforts and prevailing trends to integrate multidisciplinary domain professions into machine-acknowledgeable, data-driven processes in a two-fold organization: examining information uncertainty sources in knowledge representation and exploring knowledge decomposition with a three-tier knowledge-integrated machine learning paradigm. This approach balances holist and reductionist perspectives in the engineering domain.<Br>
