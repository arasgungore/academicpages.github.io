excerpt: In a rapidly evolving machine-learning landscape, the ever-growing hunger for vast datasets often stalls progress, especially in fields where data might be sparse or inconsistent. We delve into Component-based Machine Learning (CBML) — a technique that seamlessly marries domain-specific knowledge with data-driven models’ organization. By encoding this specialized knowledge as semantic information directly into the model’s architecture, we unlock unparalleled efficiencies in data utilization. More importantly, CBML heralds a new frontier in machine learning's robustness, especially when tasked with predictions from extremely limited datasets. Dive into the manuscript to explore the myriad advantages of this approach and understand its potential in transforming real-world data applications in building engineering and beyond.

**Abstract**: <br>
The demand for a huge amount of data for machine learning (ML) applications is currently a bottleneck in an empirically dominated field. We propose a method to combine prior knowledge with data-driven methods to significantly reduce their data dependency. In this study, component-based machine learning (CBML) as the knowledge-encoded data-driven method is examined in the context of energy-efficient building engineering. It encodes the abstraction of building structural knowledge as semantic information in the model organization. We design a case experiment to understand the efficacy of knowledge-encoded ML in sparse data input (1% - 0.0125% sampling rate). The result reveals its three advanced features compared with pure ML methods: 1. Significant improvement in the robustness of ML to extremely small-size and inconsistent datasets; 2. Efficient data utilization from different entities’ record collections; 3. Characteristics of accepting incomplete data with high interpretability and reduced training time. All these features provide a promising path to alleviating the deployment bottleneck of data-intensive methods and contribute to efficient real-world data usage. Moreover, four necessary prerequisites are summarized in this study that ensures the target scenario benefits by combining prior knowledge and ML generalization.<br>
