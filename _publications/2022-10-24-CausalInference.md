- An analogy between personal experience and physical knowledge provides a channel for integrating data-driven and knowledge-based methods through causal DAGs. This separation would achieve a fast cross-sectional examination and avoid conducting erroneous conclusions.
- Causal model provides a data-driven knowledge extraction method for design process analysis with reduced computational difficulty; The causal model allows users to quickly check potential design alternatives in a higher dimension.
- We clarify the boundary of design assistance based on DAGs. The growth of DAG with reduced uncertainties aligns with the nature of the design process.
- A four-step framework is proposed to implement causal inference into the design domain with causal structure finding and causal relationship quantification.

**Abstract**: “What-if” questions are intuitively generated and commonly asked during the design process. Engineers and architects need to inherently conduct design decisions, progressing from one phase to another. They either use empirical domain experience, simulations, or data-driven methods to acquire consequential feedback. We take an example from an interdisciplinary domain of energy-efficient building design to argue that the current methods for decision support have limitations or deficiencies in four aspects: parametric independency identification, gaps in integrating knowledge-based and data-driven approaches, less explicit model interpretation, and ambiguous decision support boundaries. In this study, we first clarify the nature of dynamic experience in individuals and constant principal knowledge in design. Subsequently, we introduce causal inference into the domain. A four-step process is proposed to discover and analyze parametric dependencies in a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient manner by identifying the causal diagram with interventions. The causal diagram provides a nexus for integrating domain knowledge with data-driven methods, providing interpretability and testability against the domain experience within the design space. Extracting causal structures from the data is close to the nature design reasoning process. As an illustration, we applied the properties of the proposed estimators through simulations. The paper concludes with a feasibility study demonstrating the proposed framework’s realization.
