**Abstract**: To establish a design-embedded recommending assistance, we extend a machine assistance framework into a multi-objective scheme with three indicators predicted by a set of trained machine learning (ML) models: energy consumption, environmental impact, and operational cost, based on the target evaluation outputs of (Energy Performance Certification) EPC data from the UK. The set of ML models shares the same parametric representation with different target outputs. The framework integrates two essential interdisciplinary abilities: 1. Output design scheme distributions evaluation under incomplete inputs with their inherent uncertainties; 2. Analyze possible input assumptions' consequences as representative of the potential output value space via model interpretation in the dynamic interactive process.
