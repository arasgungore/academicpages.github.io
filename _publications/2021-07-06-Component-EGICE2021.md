excerpt: 'Imagine building performance prediction as a dynamic Lego set, where each block represents a distinct component of the design. Just as Lego pieces can be assembled in countless ways to create varied structures, our component-based machine learning (CBML) approach offers a modular and scalable solution for predicting time-series energy performance in building designs. Dive into our manuscript to uncover how weâ€™ve redefined building performance simulation with CBML, ensuring accurate hourly energy predictions that pave the way for optimized equipment sizing, efficient energy demand control, and balanced network loads.'

**Abstract**: <Br>
The building industry has benefited by building performance simulation (BPS) for design assistance. Machine learning (ML) has been widely used for quick performance prediction; however, it lacks the flexibility to scale for new designs. By spatially and semantically decomposing the building design into components, this article links the ML approach with the system engineering paradigm of BPS to develop component-based machine learning (CBML). While previous use of CMBL focused on point predictions, this study proves that the CBML is able to predict dynamic time-series energy performance for new design cases by deriving a set of reusable model components. We trained and tested the ML model on a dataset of 1000 examples. The objective is to ascertain the ability of the ML model to generalize via different decomposition levels. Hourly energy predictions during the design phase are useful for equipment sizing, controlling peak energy demands, and leveling the load in the networks.<Br>
