**Abstract**: 
Modeling, forecasting, and optimizing the dynamic of engineering scenarios as inverse problems with hidden physics is often effort-wise expensive and requires different first-principles or symbolism formulations. Meanwhile, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted attention in most fields. Yet, due to its inherent connectionism and data-driven nature, significant progress has been made in areas where the data fundamental is advantageous but not domains built on highly integrated explicit laws and prior knowledge, such as building engineering. The recent decade trend of digitalization has boomed the volume of observational data, resulting in accelerated adaptation of connectionism approaches (machine learning, ML) in the field but less efficiently incorporated with domain knowledge. Similar to the long debate of symbolism and connectionism (mathematical models) in the AI community, first-principles models (known as physics-based, rule-based, or knowledge-based models) and data-driven approaches exist in parallel. Research for the process development to integrate both paradigms to transfer and utilize domain knowledge in a data-driven process is missing. 
This study emphasizes efforts and prevailing trends to integrate multidisciplinary domain professions into machine acknowledgeable, data-driven processes to reconcile the integration gap between symbolism and connectionism representative approaches on a fundamental basis in the building engineering domain.
