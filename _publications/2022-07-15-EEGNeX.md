excerpt: '<b>“In our world, communication is everything. Just as we use words to share ideas, our brains have their own unique language, spoken through electrical signals. I embarked on a journey to better understand this language, using cutting-edge deep learning methods. The heart of this project is EEGNeX, a tool I developed to decode these brain signals. And this isn\'t just a research exercise. My goal was to see if giving our computers a deeper understanding of our brain\'s language could make our interactions smoother and more intuitive. Dive into this manuscript to explore how a blend of technology and neuroscience might just change the way we communicate.</b>'

**Abstract**: <br>This study examines the efficacy of various neural network (NN) models in interpreting mental constructs via electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Through the assessment of 16 prevalent NN models and their variants across four brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms, we gauged their information representation capability. Rooted in comprehensive literature review findings, we proposed EEGNeX, a novel, purely ConvNet-based architecture. We pitted it against both existing cutting-edge strategies and the Mother of All BCI Benchmarks (MOABB) involving 11 distinct EEG motor imagination (MI) classification tasks and revealed that EEGNeX surpasses other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it shows up to 2.1%–8.5% improvement in the classification accuracy in different scenarios with statistical significance (p < 0.05) compared to its competitors. This study not only provides deeper insights into designing efficient NN models for EEG data but also lays the groundwork for future explorations into the relationship between bioelectric brain signals and NN architectures. For the benefit of broader scientific collaboration, we have made all benchmark models, including EEGNeX, publicly available at (https://github.com/chenxiachan/EEGNeX).<br>
